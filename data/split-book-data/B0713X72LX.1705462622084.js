window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Named One of the Most Anticipated Thriller Novels of 2017 by Bustle! </p> <p><b>The newest propulsive audiobook from the author of <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> instant best seller <i>Behind Closed Doors</i>.</b> </p> <p>If you can't trust yourself, who can you trust? </p> <p>Cass is having a hard time since the night she saw the car in the woods, on the winding rural road, in the middle of a downpour, with the woman sitting inside - the woman who was killed. She's been trying to put the crime out of her mind; what could she have done, really? It's a dangerous road to be on in the middle of a storm. Her husband would be furious if he knew she'd broken her promise not to take that shortcut home. And she probably would only have been hurt herself if she'd stopped. </p> <p>But since then, she's been forgetting every little thing: where she left the car, if she took her pills, the alarm code, why she ordered a pram when she doesn't have a baby. </p> <p>The only thing she can't forget is that woman, the woman she might have saved, and the terrible nagging guilt. </p> <p>Or the silent calls she's receiving, or the feeling that someone's watching her... </p> <p>You won't be able to hit pause on B. A. Paris' <i>The Breakdown</i>, the next chilling audiobook from the best-selling author of <i>Behind Closed Doors</i>. </p>";
