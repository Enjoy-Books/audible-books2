You have to be rich to have a house there, and Fred and Sheila Merton certainly <i>are</i> rich. But even all their money can't protect them when a killer comes to call. The Mertons are brutally murdered after a fraught Easter dinner with their three adult kids. Who, of course, are devastated.</p> <p>Or are they? They each stand to inherit millions.

After all, if one of the family were capable of something as gruesome as this, you'd know.</p> <p>Wouldn't you?</p>";
