window.bookSummaryJSON = "Jodi Picoult earned rave notices for her debut novel <i>Songs of the Humpback Whale</i>. Now this gifted young writer turns her considerable literary talents to the story of a young woman overcome by the demands of having a family. <p>Written with astonishing clarity and evocative detail, convincing in its depiction of emotional pain, love, and vulnerability, <i>Harvesting the Heart</i> recalls the writing of Alice Hoffman and Sue Miller. Paige has only a few vivid memories of her mother, who left when she was five. Now, having left her father behind in Chicago for dreams of art school and marriage to an ambitious young doctor, she finds herself with a child of her own.</p> <p>But her mother's absence, and shameful memories of her past, make her doubt both her maternal ability and her sense of self worth. Out of Paige's struggle to find wholeness, Jodi Picoult crafts an absorbing novel peopled by richly drawn characters and explores issues and emotions readers can relate to.</p>";
