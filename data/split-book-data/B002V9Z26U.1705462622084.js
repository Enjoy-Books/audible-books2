window.bookSummaryJSON = "Former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> writer Patricia Marx brings her clever, deadpan humor to this addictive novel about one woman's comic obsession with her first boyfriend. <p> A neurotic young graduate student looking for distraction from her doomed thesis is inexplicably swept off her feet by a narcissistic philosophy professor. The obsession continues even after he has dumped her for someone even needier and she has given up on school and become a television writer. Meeting again in New York, they begin an adulterous affair that, of course, can only end in some kind of crisis.</p> <p> Smart, lively, and original, <i>Him Her Him Again the End of Him</i> is an endlessly entertaining re-imagining of the comedy of manners.</p>";
