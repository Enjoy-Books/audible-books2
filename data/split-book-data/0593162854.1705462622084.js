window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From Tana French, author of the forthcoming novel&nbsp;</b><b><i>The Searcher</i></b><b>, a&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;best-selling novel that “proves anew that [Tana French] is one of the most talented crime writers alive”&nbsp;(</b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p><b>“Required reading for anyone who appreciates tough, unflinching intelligence and ingenious plotting.” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Mick “Scorcherˮ Kennedy is the star of the Dublin Murder Squad. He plays by the books and plays hard, and thatʼs how the biggest case of the year ends up in his hands.</p> <p>On one of the half-abandoned \"luxury\" developments that litter Ireland, Patrick Spain and his two young children have been murdered. His wife, Jenny, is in intensive care. At first, Scorcher thinks itʼs going to be an easy solve, but too many small things can't be explained: the half dozen baby monitors pointed at holes smashed in the Spains' walls, the files erased from the familyʼs computer, the story Jenny told her sister about a shadowy intruder slipping past the house's locks. And this neighborhood - once called Broken Harbor - holds memories for Scorcher and his troubled sister, Dina: childhood memories that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control.</p>";
