She barely escapes with her life but cannot save the two others gunned down before her disbelieving eyes.

But the deeper Vicki probes, the more she becomes convinced that the murders weren't random and the killers were more ruthless than she thought.</p> <p>When another murder thrusts Vicki together with an unlikely ally, she buckles up for a wild ride down a dangerous street and into the crosshairs of a conspiracy as powerful as it is relentless.</p>";
