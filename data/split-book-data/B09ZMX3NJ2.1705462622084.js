But as teenagers, their lives took them in different directions. Keith’s father became a legendary prosecutor, determined to “clean up the Coast.” Hugh’s father became the “Boss” of Biloxi’s criminal underground. Keith went to law school and followed in his father’s footsteps. Hugh preferred the nightlife and worked in his father’s clubs. The two families were headed for a showdown, one that would happen in a courtroom.</p> <p>Life itself hangs in the balance&nbsp;in <i>The Boys from Biloxi, </i>a sweeping saga rich with history and with a large cast of unforgettable characters.</p> <p><b><i>Don’t miss John Grisham’s new book, </i></b><b>THE EXCHANGE: AFTER</b><b><i> THE FIRM, coming soon!</i></b></p>";
