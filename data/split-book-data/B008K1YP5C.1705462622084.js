window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With <i>Worldbinder,</i> the best-selling epic series breaks new ground. </p> <p>After the events of&nbsp;Sons of the Oak, Fallion and Jaz, the&nbsp;sons of the great Earth King Gaborn,&nbsp;are living as fugitives in their own kingdom, newly invaded and secretly controlled by supernatural beings of ultimate evil.&nbsp;The sons&nbsp;are hiding until they can regain their rightful places in the land. </p> <p>Fallion&nbsp;seems destined to heal the world and feels the supernatural calling to act.&nbsp;When he summons his powers to do so, though, two entire worlds&nbsp;collapse into one,&nbsp;and every living thing in both worlds is transformed into an entirely new being - yet still somehow the same. Evil is certainly still the same - and may have influenced all of this for a terrible purpose. </p> <p>David Farland is the pseudonym of Dave Wolverton, an American author of fantasy fiction who lives in Utah with his wife and five children. He was a budding author during his college years but came to prominence when he won the Writers of the Future L. Ron Hubbard Gold Award, for <i>On My Way to Paradise,</i> in 1987. He has achieved much renown in the science fiction field, but fans may know him best as the author of Star Wars novels; <i>The Courtship of Princess Leia</i> was met with acclaim from critics and readers alike and became a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling novel.</p>";
