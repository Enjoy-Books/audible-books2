window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Selected as One of Barack Obama’s Summer 2022 Reading List Picks!</b></p> <p><b>In this </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestseller and </b><b><i>Today </i></b><b>show Read with Jenna Book Club Pick, one lapse in judgement lands a young mother in a government reform program where custody of her child hangs in the balance, in this “surreal” (</b><b><i>People</i></b><b>), “remarkable” (</b><b><i>Vogue</i></b><b>), and “infuriatingly timely” (</b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>) debut novel.</b></p> <p>Frida Liu is struggling. She doesn’t have a career worthy of her Chinese immigrant parents’ sacrifices. She can’t persuade her husband, Gust, to give up his wellness-obsessed younger mistress. Only with Harriet, their cherubic daughter, does Frida finally attain the perfection expected of her. Harriet may be all she has, but she is just enough.</p> <p>Until Frida has a very bad day.</p> <p>The state has its eye on mothers like Frida. The ones who check their phones, letting their children get injured on the playground; who let their children walk home alone. Because of one moment of poor judgement, a host of government officials will now determine if Frida is a candidate for a Big Brother-like institution that measures the success or failure of a mother’s devotion.</p> <p>Faced with the possibility of losing Harriet, Frida must prove that a bad mother can be redeemed. That she can learn to be good.</p> <p>An “intense” (<i>Oprah Daily</i>), “captivating” (<i>Today</i>) page-turner that is also a transgressive novel of ideas about the perils of “perfect” upper-middle class parenting; the violence enacted upon women by both the state and, at times, one another; the systems that separate families; and the boundlessness of love, <i>The School for Good Mothers</i> introduces, in Frida, an everywoman for the ages. Using dark wit to explore the pains and joys of the deepest ties that bind us, Chan has written a modern literary classic.</p>";
