window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"...the events in <i>Glass House</i> challenge Gamache's conscience unlike any of the previous audiobooks, with Bathurst prying open the hero's heart and soul and laying it bare for listeners to experience at a visceral level.\" — <i>Audiofile Magazine</i> </p> <p>AN AUGUST 2017 LibraryReads PICK! </p> <p>When a mysterious figure appears in Three Pines one cold November day, Armand Gamache and the rest of the villagers are at first curious. Then wary. Through rain and sleet, the figure stands unmoving, staring ahead. </p> <p>From the moment its shadow falls over the village, Gamache, now Chief Superintendent of the Sûreté du Québec, suspects the creature has deep roots and a dark purpose. Yet he does nothing. What can he do? Only watch and wait. And hope his mounting fears are not realized. </p> <p>But when the figure vanishes overnight and a body is discovered, it falls to Gamache to discover if a debt has been paid or levied. </p> <p>Months later, on a steamy July day as the trial for the accused begins in Montréal, Chief Superintendent Gamache continues to struggle with actions he set in motion that bitter November, from which there is no going back. More than the accused is on trial. Gamache’s own conscience is standing in judgment. </p> <p>In <i>Glass Houses</i>, her latest utterly gripping audiobook, number-one <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Louise Penny shatters the conventions of the crime novel to explore what Gandhi called the court of conscience. A court that supersedes all others. </p>";
