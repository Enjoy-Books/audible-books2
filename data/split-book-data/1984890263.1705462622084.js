But one casual comment leads to another...and now there’s no going back. Rumor has it that a notorious killer, who committed a brutal crime as a child, has been living a new life under an assumed identity in Joanna’s seaside town. So who is the criminal hidden in their midst? Suspicion falls on everyone.</p> <p>As Joanna becomes obsessed with the case, her curiosity will expose her son and his father to the supposedly reformed murderer - who may be ready to kill again.
