window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b></p> <p><b>John Grisham’s first work of nonfiction: a true crime story that will terrify anyone who believes in the presumption of innocence.</b></p> <p><b>Soon to be a Netflix original documentary series&nbsp;</b></p> <p>“Both an American tragedy and [Grisham’s] strongest legal thriller yet, all the more gripping because it happens to be true.” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>In the town of Ada, Oklahoma, Ron Williamson was going to be the next Mickey Mantle. But on his way to the Big Leagues, Ron stumbled, his dreams broken by drinking, drugs, and women. Then, on a winter night in 1982, not far from Ron’s home, a young cocktail waitress named Debra Sue Carter was savagely murdered. The investigation led nowhere. Until, on the flimsiest evidence, it led to Ron Williamson. The washed-up small-town hero was charged, tried, and sentenced to death - in a trial littered with lying witnesses and tainted evidence that would shatter a man’s already broken life, and let a true killer go free.&nbsp;</p> <p>Impeccably researched, grippingly told, filled with 11th-hour drama, this audio edition of <i>The Innocent Man </i>plays like an edge-of-your-seat legal thriller. It is a book no American can afford to miss.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Grisham has crafted a legal thriller every bit as suspenseful and fast-paced as his best-selling fiction.” (<i>The Boston Globe</i>)</p> <p>“A gritty, harrowing true-crime story.” (<i>Time</i>)</p> <p>“A triumph.” (<i>The Seattle Times</i>)</p>";
