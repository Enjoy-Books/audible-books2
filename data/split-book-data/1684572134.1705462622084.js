window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The new novel from award-winning author Lisa Sandlin catches up with the almost-murdered secretary Delpha Wade (<i>The Do-Right</i>, 2015, set in 1973) as she's released from a hospital in order to be tucked into the back seat of a police cruiser. Her boss, PI Tom Phelan, sets out to spring her. He needs her back in his investigation business, where he'll soon be chasing a skulking grand larcenist and plotting how to keep a ganjapreneur out of the grabby hands of a brand new agency, the DEA. Delpha digs through old records and knocks on strange doors to unravel the dangerous case of two brothers with beaucoup aliases - verifying that sometimes truth is not true, but murder is always murder.</p>";
