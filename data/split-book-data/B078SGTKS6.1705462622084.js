window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Narrators Daniel Thomas May and Caitlin Davies breathe life into the large cast of Burke's debut science fiction...both excel at utilizing accents, inflections, and personality traits to quickly build characterizations. The unusual cadence and inflections used for the aliens work to captivating effect.\" — </b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i></b><b><br> <br> In </b><b><i>Semiosis,</i></b><b> debut author Sue Burke's character driven audiobook of first contact, human survival hinges on an bizarre alliance.</b><br> <br> Only mutual communication can forge an alliance with the planet's sentient species and prove that mammals are more than tools.<br> <br> Forced to land on a planet they aren't prepared for, human colonists rely on their limited resources to survive. The planet provides a lush but inexplicable landscape—trees offer edible, addictive fruit one day and poison the next, while the ruins of an alien race are found entwined in the roots of a strange plant. Conflicts between generations arise as they struggle to understand one another and grapple with an unknowable alien intellect.</p>";
