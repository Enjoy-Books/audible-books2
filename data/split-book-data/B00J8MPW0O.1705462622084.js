window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><em><strong>NEW YORK TIMES</strong></em><strong> BESTSELLER&nbsp;• Karin Slaughter, author of the&nbsp;bestselling Will Trent novels, is widely acclaimed as “one of the best crime novelists in America” (</strong><em><strong>The Washington Post</strong></em><strong>). Now she delivers her first stand-alone novel: an epic story of a city in the midst of seismic upheaval, a serial killer targeting cops, and a divided police force tasked with bringing a madman to justice.</strong></p> <p>Atlanta, 1974. It’s Kate Murphy’s first day on the job, and the Atlanta Police Department is seething after the murder of an officer. Before the day has barely begun, she already suspects she’s not cut out to be a cop. Her male uniform is too big, she can’t handle a gun, and she’s rapidly learning that the APD is hardly a place that welcomes women. Worse still, in the ensuing manhunt, she’ll be partnered with Maggie Lawson, a cop with her own ax to grind (and a brother and uncle already on the force)—a strategy meant to isolate Kate and Maggie from the action. But the move will backfire, putting them right at the heart of it.</p> <p><em>Cop Town</em> is an incredibly atmospheric nail-biter from the author the <em>Huffington Post</em> called an “exemplary storyteller” and “one of the great talents of the twenty-first century.”</p>";
