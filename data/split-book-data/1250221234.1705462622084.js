window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times Book Review</i> recommends M.T. Edvardsson’s <i>A Nearly Normal Family</i> and lauds it as a “page-turner” that forces the reader to confront “the compromises we make with ourselves to be the people we believe our beloveds expect”. (<i>NYTimes</i> Book Review Summer Reading Issue)</p> <p>M.T. Edvardsson’s <i>A Nearly Normal Family</i> is a gripping legal thriller that forces the listener to consider: How far would you go to protect the ones you love? In this twisted narrative of love and murder, a horrific crime makes a seemingly normal family question everything they thought they knew about their life - and one another.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eighteen-year-old Stella Sandell stands accused of the brutal murder of a man almost 15 years her senior. She is an ordinary teenager from an upstanding local family. What reason could she have to know a shady businessman, let alone to kill him?&nbsp;</p> <p>Stella’s father, a pastor, and mother, a criminal defense attorney, find their moral compasses tested as they defend their daughter, while struggling to understand why she is a suspect. Told in an unusual three-part structure, <i>A Nearly Normal Family</i> asks the questions: How well do you know your own children? How far would you go to protect them?</p>";
