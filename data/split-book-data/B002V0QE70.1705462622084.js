window.bookSummaryJSON = "Myron hasn't heard from Terese Collins in years. Not since their affair ended with no explanation. There had been no contact since, so her call catches him off guard. She's in Paris, she says, in trouble, and only Myron can help. She tells him a sad story she's never before revealed: a good marriage, her struggles to get pregnant, the happiest moment of her life when her only child was born, the day everything she'd ever loved was taken from her. In the years since, Terese has had no contact with her ex-husband, until the phone call that brought her to Paris. <p>When she gets there he's been murdered, and she's a suspect. But then comes a startling piece of evidence that turns the entire case upside down, laying bare Terese's long-buried family secrets in a most shocking way and leaving Myron nowhere to turn for help. Caught in a foreign landscape where nothing is as it seems, he must tear apart the city - and eventually the globe - fighting for answers to unfathomable questions that will take Myron, and millions of Harlan Coben readers, where they have never gone before.</p>";
