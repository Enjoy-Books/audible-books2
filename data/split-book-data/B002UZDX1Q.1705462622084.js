window.bookSummaryJSON = "When Chaz Perron's wife discovers that he is running a scam (posing as a marine biologist to doctor water samples so that an agribusiness tycoon can continue illegally dumping fertilizer into the Everglades), he pushes her overboard from a cruise liner. Unlucky for Chaz, Joey survives clutching a bale of Jamaican pot. Rescued from the Atlantic by a former police officer, Mick Stranahan, she decides not to report him but instead haunt and taunt him, with Mick's help, by playing dead. As a result, Chaz becomes increasingly erratic and inept, a fact noticed by his ruthless and cold-blooded coworkers. Also, the six-time-married Mick rediscovers the thwarted romantic in him, believing that the seventh time might be the charm.";
