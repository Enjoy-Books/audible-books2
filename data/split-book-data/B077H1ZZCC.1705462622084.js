window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Irish author John Connolly delivers the third novel in his best-selling, critically acclaimed series featuring troubled ex-cop turned detective Charlie Parker. </p> <p>John Connolly takes battered ex-cop Charlie Parker on his third outing after <i>Every Dead Thing</i> and <i>Dark Hollow</i>. Still struggling with the horrific ghosts of his past, Parker is now a disillusioned private eye hired to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of Grace Peltier - which neither her father nor a former US senator believes was suicide. The trail leads to a mass grave in Northern Maine where a Baptist community disappeared 40 years earlier. The deaths of the Baptists and Grace are connected and point in the direction of a shadowy organization known as the Fellowship. With the assistance of some idiosyncratic and murderous acolytes, Parker soon confronts the Fellowship's demonic leader and finds himself caught in a situation more gruesome than even he could ever have imagined. </p>";
