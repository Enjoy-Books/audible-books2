window.bookSummaryJSON = "Edith Lavery, the pretty daughter of an accountant, meets gossip-column favorite Charles Broughton (Earl of Broughton and heir to the Marquess of Uckfield) at Ascot. When he proposes and she accepts, does she really love him, or is she merely dazzled by his title and money? <p>In a tale that mixes contemporary Jane Austen with the brilliant social commentary of <i>Gosford Park</i>, Julian Fellowes chronicles Edith's rise and fall with twists and turns aplenty. Through the eyes of his narrator, a journeyman actor who manages to negotiate the choppy waters of snobbery and excess as he moves between the upper and middle classes, in <i>Snobs</i> Fellowes gives us a delicious comedy of manners to rival Oscar Wilde at his wittiest.</p>";
