window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Magdalena Yoder, Amish-Mennonite proprietor of the Pennsylvania Dutch Inn, travels to Farmersburg, Ohio for the funeral of her second cousin (twice removed) who had the unfortunate luck of drowning in a vat of milk - and, as Magdalena knows, Amish men just don't go swimming in milk in the middle of February. Something's definitely rotten in Farmersburg. </p> <p>When another relative is found belly up, Magdalena puts her (impressive, but attractive nonetheless, thank you very much) nose to the scent and discovers that a vicious cheese rivalry may be the cause of all this mayhem! </p> <p>In between keeping tabs on her saucy sister, Susannah, avoiding her sardine-loving host and spending time with her new boyfriend, Aaron Miller (a.k.a. Pooky Bear), Magdalena must find the killer - before more Yoders bite the dust! </p>";
