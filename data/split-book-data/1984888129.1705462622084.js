window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two-time Edgar Award-winning author Lori Roy entangles listeners in a heart-pounding tale of two women battling for survival against a century's worth of hate. </b></p> <p>On the day a black truck rattles past her house and a Klan flyer lands in her front yard, 10-year-old Beth disappears from her Simmonsville, Georgia home. Armed with skills sharpened while caring for an alcoholic mother, she must battle to survive the days and months ahead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Seven years later, Imogene Coulter is burying her father - a Klan leader she has spent her life distancing herself from - and trying to escape the memories his funeral evokes. But Imogene is forced to confront secrets long held by the town and her own family when, while clearing out her father's apparent hideout on the day of his funeral, she finds a child. Young and alive, in an abandoned basement, and behind a door that only locks from the outside.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Imogene begins to uncover the truth of what happened to young Beth all those years ago, her father's heir-apparent to the Klan's leadership threatens her and her family. Driven by a love that extends beyond the ties of blood, Imogene struggles to save a girl she never knew but will now be bound to forever, and to save herself and the ones dearest to her. Tightly coiled and chilling, G<i>one Too Long</i> ensnares, twists, and exposes the high price we are willing to pay for the ones we love.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>Gone Too Long:</i></b></p> <p>“Florida writer Lori Roy brings a powerful literary voice to the crime genre with this dark, corrosive tale.... <i>Gone Too Long</i> is a hauntingly detailed story of survival.” (<i>The Chicago Tribune</i>,&nbsp;\"What to read this summer: Best books by genre\")&nbsp;</p> <p>“This compelling, issue-oriented story by Edgar Award-winning author Roy is a creepy, eerie account of a young girl and a community held hostage by the Klan.” (<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review)</p>";
