window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the \"pulse-quickening\" (<i>Good Housekeeping</i> UK) <i>In a Dark, Dark Wood</i> and <i>The Woman in Cabin 10</i> comes Ruth Ware's highly anticipated third novel, featuring her signature \"verve and energy\" (<i>Library Journal</i>). </p> <p>On a cool June morning, Isa Wilde, a resident of the seemingly idyllic coastal village of Salten, is walking her dog along a tidal estuary. Before she can stop him, Isa's dog charges into the water to retrieve what first appears to be a wayward stick - and to her horror, Isa discovers it's not a stick at all...but a human bone. As her three best friends from childhood converge in Salten to comfort a seriously shaken-up Isa, terrifying discoveries are made, and their collective history slowly unravels. </p> <p>Tackling the slipperiness of memories, the relativity of truth, and the danger of obsessive friendships, <i>The Lying Game</i> is a gripping mystery with compelling characters and electric prose, resulting in a can't-stop-listening thriller. </p>";
