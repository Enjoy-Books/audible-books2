window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1</b><b><i> NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BESTSELLER • Jake Brigance is back! The hero of </b><b><i>A Time to Kill, </i></b><b>one of the most popular novels of our time, returns in a courtroom drama that </b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b> says is \"riveting\" and \"suspenseful.\"</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Clanton, Mississippi. 1990. Jake Brigance finds himself embroiled in a deeply divisive trial when the court appoints him attorney for Drew Gamble, a timid sixteen-year-old boy accused of murdering a local deputy. Many in Clanton want a swift trial and the death penalty, but Brigance digs in and discovers that there is more to the story than meets the eye. Jake’s fierce commitment to saving Drew from the gas chamber puts his career, his financial security, and the safety of his family on the line.&nbsp;</p> <p>In what may be the most personal and accomplished legal thriller of John Grisham’s storied career, we deepen our acquaintance with the iconic Southern town of Clanton and the vivid cast of characters that so many listeners know and cherish. The result is a richly rewarding novel that is both timely and timeless, full of wit, drama, and—most of all—heart.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bursting with all the courthouse scheming, small-town intrigue, and stunning plot twists that have become the hallmarks of the master of the legal thriller, <i>A Time for Mercy</i> is John Grisham’s most powerful courtroom drama yet.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a time to kill and a time for justice. Now comes <i>A Time for Mercy</i>.</p>";
