At the start of summer, a lonely and thoughtful teenager, Evie Boyd, sees a group of girls in the park and is immediately caught by their freedom, their careless dress, their dangerous aura of abandon. Soon Evie is in thrall to Suzanne, a mesmerizing older girl, and is drawn into the circle of a soon-to-be infamous cult and the man who is its charismatic leader. Hidden in the hills, their sprawling ranch is eerie and run down, but to Evie it is exotic, thrilling, charged - a place where she feels desperate to be accepted. As she spends more time away from her mother and the rhythms of her daily life, and as her obsession with Suzanne intensifies, Evie does not realize she is coming closer and closer to unthinkable violence.</p> <p>Finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize<br> Finalist for the National Book Critics Circle John Leonard Award<br> Shortlisted for The Center for Fiction First Novel Prize<br> <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> Editors’ Choice<br> Emma Cline - One of Granta’s Best of Young American Novelists&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>The Girls</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>“Spellbinding...a seductive and arresting coming-of-age story.” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)</p> <p>“Extraordinary...
