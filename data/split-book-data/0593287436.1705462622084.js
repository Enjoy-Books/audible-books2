window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BESTSELLER • The specter of graduation looms large as Naomi Novik’s groundbreaking, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling trilogy continues in the stunning sequel to </b><b><i>A Deadly Education</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p><b>HUGO AWARD FINALIST • LOCUS AWARD FINALIST • ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: </b><b><i>Polygon, Thrillist, She Reads</i></b><b> • “The climactic graduation-day battle will bring cheers, tears, and gasps as the second of the Scholomance trilogy closes with a breathtaking cliff-hanger.”—</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><b> (starred review)</b></p> <p><i>In Wisdom, Shelter</i>. That’s the official motto of the Scholomance. I suppose you could even argue that it’s true—only the wisdom is hard to come by, so the shelter’s rather scant.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our beloved school does its best to devour all its students—but now that I’ve reached my senior year and have actually won myself a handful of allies, it’s suddenly developed a very particular craving for me. And even if I somehow make it through the endless waves of maleficaria that it keeps throwing at me in between grueling homework assignments, I haven’t any idea how my allies and I are going to make it through the graduation hall alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Unless, of course, I finally accept my foretold destiny of dark sorcery and destruction. That would certainly let me sail straight out of here. The course of wisdom, surely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But I’m not giving in—not to the mals, not to fate, and especially not to the Scholomance. I’m going to get myself and my friends out of this hideous place for good—even if it’s the&nbsp;last&nbsp;thing I do.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>With keen insight and mordant humor, Novik reminds us that sometimes it is not enough to rewrite the rules—sometimes, you need to toss out the entire rulebook.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The magic of the Scholomance trilogy will continue in </b><b><i>The Golden Enclaves</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
