window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Her Perfect Life </p> <p>Is a Perfect Lie </p> <p>Ani FaNelli seems to have it all: a glamorous job at a glossy magazine, an enviable figure with the wardrobe to match, and a handsome fiancé from a distinguished blue-blood family. But Ani FaNelli is an invention, that veneer of perfection carefully assembled in an attempt to distance herself from a shocking, sordid past. </p> <p>As her wedding draws near, a documentary producer invites Ani to speak about the chilling incident that took place when she was a teenager at the prestigious Bradley School. Determined once and for all to silence the whispers of suspicion and blame, Ani must weigh her options carefully, when telling the whole truth could destroy the picture-perfect life she's worked so hard to create. </p> <p>With a singular voice and a twist you won't see coming, <i>Luckiest Girl Alive</i> explores the deep-seated desire to fit in and the unbearable pressure that so many women feel to \"have it all\". Ani FaNelli is a complex and vulnerable heroine - one whose sharp edges protect a truth that will move, scandalize, and surprise you. </p>";
