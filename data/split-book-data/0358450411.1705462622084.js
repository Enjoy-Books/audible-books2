window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"This droll romp is a latter-day Miss Marple.”</b> <b>—</b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br> <br> <b>Murder leaps off the page when crime novelists begin to turn up dead in this intricate new novel by internationally best-selling author Elly Griffiths, a literary mystery perfect for fans of Anthony Horowitz and Agatha Christie.</b></p> <p>The death of a ninety-year-old woman with a heart condition should not be suspicious. Detective Sergeant Harbinder Kaur certainly sees nothing out of the ordinary when Peggy’s caretaker, Natalka, begins to recount Peggy Smith’s passing.</p> <p>But Natalka had a reason to be at the police station:&nbsp;while clearing out Peggy’s flat, she noticed&nbsp;an unusual number of crime novels, all dedicated to Peggy. And each psychological thriller&nbsp;included a mysterious postscript<i>: PS: for PS.&nbsp;</i>When a gunman breaks into the flat to steal a book&nbsp;and its author is found dead shortly thereafter—Detective&nbsp;Kaur begins to think that perhaps there is no such thing as an unsuspicious death after all.</p> <p>And then things escalate: from an Aberdeen literary festival to the streets of Edinburgh, writers are being targeted. DS Kaur embarks on a road trip across Europe and reckons with how&nbsp;<i>exactly&nbsp;</i>authors can think up such realistic crimes . . .</p>";
