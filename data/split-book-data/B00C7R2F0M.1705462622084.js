window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The second electrifying thriller from the \"gifted writer\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) and author of <i>A Conflict of Interest.</i></b> </p> <p>A high-profile attorney in the middle of a leave of absence following a personal tragedy is drawn back into the legal arena amidst a media firestorm when he agrees to represent a popular rap artist accused of brutally murdering his pop star girlfriend. With its powerful voice, pause-resisting tension, and strong cast of characters, Adam Mitznerâ€™s novels are reminiscent of such best-selling authors as Scott Turow and John Grisham.</p>";
