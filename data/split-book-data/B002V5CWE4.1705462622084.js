window.bookSummaryJSON = "For decades, Patricia Cornwell has demonstrated her extraordinary ability not only to entertain and enthrall but to surprise as well. Beginning in January 2006, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> serialized a brand-new Cornwell thriller, a book filled with all the chilling suspense, rich characters, and trademark forensics that have made her an international phenomenon. But what she does with those ingredients is a revelation. <p> A Massachusetts state investigator is called home from Knoxville, Tennessee, where he is completing a course at the National Forensic Academy. His boss, the district attorney, attractive but hard-charging, is planning to run for governor, and as a showcase she's planning to use a new crime initiative called At Risk; its motto: \"Any crime, any time.\" In particular, she's been looking for a way to employ cutting-edge DNA technology, and she thinks she's found the perfect subject in an unsolved 20-year-old murder-in Tennessee. If her office solves the case, it ought to make them all look pretty good, right? </p> <p> Her investigator is not so sure, not sure about anything to do with this woman, really, but before he can open his mouth, a shocking piece of violence intervenes, an act that shakes up not only both their lives but the lives of everyone around them. It's not a random event. Is it personal? Is it professional? Whatever it is, the implications are very, very bad indeed...and they're about to get much worse. </p> <p> Sparks fly, traps spring, twists abound. This is the master working at the top of her game.</p>";
