Even Emma and Andrew’s elder daughter - who is usually off saving the world - will be joining them at Weyfield Hall. But Olivia, a doctor, is only coming home because she has to. She’s just returned from treating an epidemic abroad and has been told she must stay in quarantine for a week...and so too should her family.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the next seven days, the Birches are locked down, cut off from the rest of humanity, and forced into each other’s orbits.
