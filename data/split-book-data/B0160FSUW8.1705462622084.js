window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling novel featuring the \"wonderfully epic hero\" (<i>People</i>) who inspired the hit film <i>Jack Reacher</i>. </p> <p>Thumbing across the scorched West Texas desert, loner Jack Reacher has nowhere to go and all the time in the world to get there. Cruising the same stretch of two-lane blacktop is pretty Carmen Greer. But for Reacher, the lift comes with a hitch. Carmen's got a story to tell, and it's a wild one. All about her husband, her family secrets, and a hometown that's pure Gothic. She's also got a plan. Jack Reacher's part of it. And before the sun sets, this ride could cost them both their lives. </p>";
