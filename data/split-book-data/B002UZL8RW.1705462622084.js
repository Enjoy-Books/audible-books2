window.bookSummaryJSON = "In his eagerly awaited fourth novel, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Nick Hornby mines the hearts and psyches of four lost souls who connect just when they've reached the end of the line. <p>Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives.</p> <p>In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances.</p> <p>Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, <i>A Long Way Down</i> is a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life.</p>";
