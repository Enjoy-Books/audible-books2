window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"A buoyant tale about the path to acceptance and joy--beginning, like all journeys, with one brave step.\" (</b><b><i>People</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"The best-selling novelist has done a masterful job of depicting the circumstances of a generation of women we seldom think about: the mothers, sisters, wives and fiances of men lost in World War I, whose job it was to remember those lost but not forgotten.\" (Associated Press)</b></p> <p>1932. After the Great War took both her beloved brother and her fianc√©, Violet Speedwell has become a \"surplus woman,\" one of a generation doomed to a life of spinsterhood after the war killed so many young men. Yet Violet cannot reconcile herself to a life spent caring for her grieving, embittered mother. After countless meals of boiled eggs and dry toast, she saves enough to move out of her mother's place and into the town of Winchester, home to one of England's grandest cathedrals. There, Violet is drawn into a society of broderers - women who embroider kneelers for the Cathedral, carrying on a centuries-long tradition of bringing comfort to worshippers.</p> <p>Violet finds support and community in the group, fulfillment in the work they create, and even a growing friendship with the vivacious Gilda. But when forces threaten her new independence and another war appears on the horizon, Violet must fight to put down roots in a place where women aren't expected to grow. Told in Chevalier's glorious prose, <i>A Single Thread</i> is a timeless story of friendship, love, and a woman crafting her own life.&nbsp;</p>";
