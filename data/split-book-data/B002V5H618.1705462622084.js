window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Thriller Award Winner, Best Hardcover Novel, 2010</b></p> <p>From a master of suspense comes a chilling new novel that explores the dangers lurking closer than you think. Because even in the perfect family, you never know what is going on behind closed doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>This is what happened...</i></p> <p>It was a case guaranteed to spark a media feeding frenzy: a young mother, blond and pretty, disappears without a trace from her South Boston home, leaving behind her four-year-old daughter as the only witness and her handsome, secretive husband as the prime suspect.</p> <p><i>In the last six hours...</i></p> <p>But from the moment Detective Sergeant D. D. Warren arrives at the Joneses - a snug little bungalow, she senses something off about the picture of wholesome normality the couple worked so hard to create. On the surface, Jason and Sandra Jones are like any other hardworking young couple raising a four-year-old child. But it is just under the surface that things grew murky.</p> <p><i>Of the world as I knew it...</i></p> <p>With the clock ticking on the life of a missing woman and the media firestorm building, Jason Jones seems more intent on destroying evidence and isolating his daughter than on searching for his beloved wife. Is the perfect husband trying to hide his guilt, or just trying to hide? And will the only witness to the crime be the killer's next victim?</p>";
