window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the ninth Ruth Galloway mystery, Ruth and Nelson investigate a string of murders and disappearances deep within the abandoned tunnels hidden far beneath the streets of Norwich. </p> <p>Norwich is riddled with old chalk-mining tunnels, but no one's sure exactly how many. When Ruth is called in to investigate a set of human remains found in one of them, she notices the bones are almost translucent - a sign they were boiled soon after death. Once more she finds herself at the helm of a murder investigation. </p> <p>Meanwhile, DCI Nelson is hunting for a missing homeless woman, Barbara, who he hears has gone \"underground\". Could she have disappeared into the labyrinth? And if so, is she connected to the body Ruth found? </p> <p>As Ruth, Nelson, and the rest of their team investigate the tunnels, they hear rumors of secret societies, cannibalism, and ritual killings. When a dead body is found with a map that appears to be of The Underground, they realize their quest to find the killer has only just begun - and that there may be more bodies underfoot. </p>";
