But when an unthinkable tragedy shatters his hard-earned normalcy, Street is left reeling from the devastating blow. </p> <p>As the criminal-justice system refuses to dispense justice, he sets out - without mercy - after the man responsible. Unwilling to stop at simply righting one wrong, Street decides to dust off his legal skills and dive back in - this time to unseat the district attorney general in Knoxville, whose callous indifference nearly let a man get away with murder. </p> <p>Now navigating a broken establishment already steeped in corruption, Street will find the retribution and redemption he so desperately needs - unless it draws him even deeper into the very chaos that derailed his life in the first place. </p>";
