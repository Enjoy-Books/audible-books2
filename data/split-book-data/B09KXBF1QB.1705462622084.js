Together, they developed a group of devoted and inseparable friends—Will, Hugh, Ryan, and Emily—during their first term. By the end of the year, April was dead.</p> <p>Now, a decade later, Hannah and Will are expecting their first child, and the man convicted of killing April, former Oxford porter John Neville, has died in prison. Relieved to have finally put the past behind her, Hannah’s world is rocked when a young journalist comes knocking and presents new evidence that Neville may have been innocent. As Hannah reconnects with old friends and delves deeper into the mystery of April’s death, she realizes that the friends she thought she knew all have something to hide…including a murder.</p> <p>“The Agatha Christie of our generation” (David Baldacci, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author) proves once again that she is “as ingenious and indefatigable as the Queen of Crime” (<i>The Washington Post</i>) with this propulsive murder mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>";
