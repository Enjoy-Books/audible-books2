Read it once for the plot; read it again for the beauty and subtlety of French's writing.\" (Sarah Lyall, </b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Cal Hooper thought a fixer-upper in a bucolic Irish village would be the perfect escape. After 25 years in the Chicago police force and a bruising divorce, he just wants to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where nothing much happens.
