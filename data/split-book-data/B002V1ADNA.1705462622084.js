window.bookSummaryJSON = "After almost 60 years as an actor, William Shatner has become one of the most beloved entertainers in the world. It seems that Shatner is everywhere. Winning an Emmy for his role on <i>Boston Legal</i>. Doing commercials for Priceline.com. In movie theaters. Singing with Ben Folds. He sits next to Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel, and he's practically a regular on Howard Stern's show. And he was recently elected to the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame. In <i>Up Till Now,</i> Shatner offers listeners the remarkable, full story of his life and explains how he got to be, well, everywhere. <p> It was the original <i>Star Trek</i> series, and later its films, that made Shatner instantly recognizable and called by name (or at least by Captain Kirk's name) across the globe. But Shatner neither began nor has ended his career with that role. From the very start, he took his skills as an actor and put them to use wherever he could. He straddled the classic world of the theater and the new world of television, whether stepping in for Christopher Plummer in Shakespeare's <i>Henry V</i> or staring at \"something on the wing\" in a classic <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode. And since then, he's gone on to star in numerous successful shows, such as <i>T. J. Hooker, Rescue 911,</i> and most recently <i>Boston Legal</i>.</p> <p> William Shatner has always been willing to take risks for his art. Who else would share the screen with thousands of tarantulas, release an album called <i>Has Been</i>, or film a racially incendiary film in the Deep South during the height of the civil-rights era? And who else would willingly paramotor into a field of waiting fans armed with paintball guns, all waiting for a chance to stun Captain...er, Shatner?</p> <p> In this touching and very funny autobiography, William Shatner reveals the man behind these unforgettable moments, and explains how he's become the worldwide star and experienced actor he is today.</p>";
