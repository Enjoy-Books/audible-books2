window.bookSummaryJSON = "It is the summer of 1976 in Oxfordshire, England, and someone is trying to kill Sally Gilmartin. The only person she can trust is her daughter, Ruth, a young single mother struggling with her own demons. Now Sally must tell her daughter the truth: she is actually Eva Delectorskaya, a Russian émigré recruited for the British Secret Service in 1939. Sally has buried many secrets along with the name Eva Delectorskaya, including her work manipulating the press in order to shift public sentiment toward U.S. involvement in the Second World War and her dangerous love affair with another spy. As the truth comes out, Ruth is drawn deeper and deeper into the astonishing events of her mother's past. <i>Restless</i> is a tour de force from William Boyd. Full of tension and drama, and based on a remarkable chapter of Anglo-American history, this is storytelling at its finest.";
