The boy's father, Buddy, a late-middle-aged womanizer who has moved to Bangkok for happy hunting, has disappeared, and money is being siphoned out of his bank and credit card accounts. </p><p>It soon becomes apparent that Buddy is in the hands of a pair of killers who prey on Bangkok's \"sexpats\"; when his accounts are empty, he'll be found, like a dozen others before him, floating facedown in a Bangkok canal with a weighted cast on his unbroken leg. His money is almost gone. </p><p>Over 48 frantic hours, Poke does everything he can to locate Buddy before it's too late. </p>";
