window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of the \"twisty-mystery\" (<i>Vulture</i>) novel <i>In a Dark, Dark Wood</i> comes <i>The Woman in Cabin 10</i>, an equally suspenseful and haunting novel from Ruth Ware - this time set at sea. </p> <p>In this tightly wound, enthralling story reminiscent of Agatha Christie's works, Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the <i>Aurora</i>, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: The cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can describe only as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for - and so the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong. </p> <p>With surprising twists, spine-tingling turns, and a setting that proves as uncomfortably claustrophobic as it is eerily beautiful, Ruth Ware offers up another taut and intense listen in <i>The Woman in Cabin 10</i> - one that will leave even the most sure-footed listener restlessly uneasy long after the last minute ends. </p> <p>Includes an excerpt from Ruth Ware's <i>The Lying Game</i>! </p>";
