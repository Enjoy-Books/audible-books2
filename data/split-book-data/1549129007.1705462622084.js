window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>INSPIRATION FOR THE ORIGINAL SERIES THE LINCOLN LAWYER—COMING SOON TO NETFLIX</b></p> <p><b>Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller is back on the job in this heart-stopping thriller from a renowned #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author.</b></p> <p><b>“One of the finest legal thrillers of the last decade” —Associated Press</b></p> <p>On the night he celebrates a big win, defense attorney Mickey Haller is pulled over by police, who find the body of a former client in the trunk of his Lincoln. Haller is immediately charged with murder but can’t post the exorbitant $5 million bail slapped on him by a vindictive judge.</p> <p>Mickey elects to represent himself and is forced to mount his defense from his jail cell in the Twin Towers Correctional Center in downtown Los Angeles. All the while he needs to look over his shoulder—as an officer of the court he is an instant target, and he makes few friends when he reveals a corruption plot within the jail.</p> <p>But the bigger plot is the one against him. Haller knows he’s been framed, whether by a new enemy or an old one. As his trusted team, including his half-brother, Harry Bosch, investigates, Haller must use all his skills in the courtroom to counter the damning evidence against him.</p> <p>Even if he can obtain a not-guilty verdict, Mickey understands that it won’t be enough. In order to be truly exonerated, he must find out who really committed the murder and why. That is the law of innocence.</p> <p>In his highest stakes case yet, the Lincoln Lawyer fights for his life and proves again why he is “a worthy colleague of Atticus Finch . . . in the front of the pack in the legal thriller game” (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>).</p> <p><b>A </b><b><i>CBS The Doctors&nbsp;</i></b><b>Book Club Pick</b><br> <b>A&nbsp;</b><b><i>People&nbsp;</i></b><b>Book of the Week Selection</b></p>";
