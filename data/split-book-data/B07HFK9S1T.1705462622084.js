window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A special live performance to satisfy <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> fans who have long wondered what became of Tevye’s beloved family. Experience an enthralling performance featuring a cast of rising Broadway stars who join actress and author Alexandra Silber in celebrating the Audible release of<i> After Anatevka</i>, the sweeping historical novel she wrote about Tevye’s second-eldest daughter, Hodel. Silber’s fascination with Hodel began when she played her in a production of <i>Fiddler</i> in London’s West End. Actors often write a backstory for the characters they play so they can fully imagine and embody them onstage. But Silber was more interested in Hodel’s fate than her history. “I had never played a character who felt so much like me,” she says. “I felt responsible for what happened to her after she boards the train to Siberia to join her revolutionary fiancé Perchik.”</p> <p>Originally commissioned by Symphony Space, a form of this concert was produced in March 2017. <i>After Anatevka Live</i> brings to life dramatic excerpts from Silber’s novel with five original songs by contemporary composer and lyricist teams, plus two much-loved songs from <i>Fiddler</i> and one gem that was cut from the final song book. Directed by Carolyn Cantor with musical direction by Ben Moss and an introduction from Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning <i>Fiddler</i> lyricist Sheldon Harnick, this is a charming and magical event for any lover of musical theater.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Cover art photo by Michael Kushner</i>&nbsp;</p>";
