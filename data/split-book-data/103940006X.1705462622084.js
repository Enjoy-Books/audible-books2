window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Spellmonger series continues with a search for answers in </b><b><i>The Lost Land of Anghysbel</i></b><b>....</b></p> <p>After winning two wars against the Nemovorti, Minalan plans an expedition to The Lost Valley of Anghysbel, in the far north of his realm. It's there, in the caldera of a supervolcano at the edge of the tundra, he suspects many of the answers he so desperately needs might be hidden. The only problem is that thanks to the anti-magical properties of the jevolar, his spells won’t work; he’ll be without magic for the first time since he came into his Talent. On this quest for the knowledge to save the world, the stakes are too high to be concerned about such things.&nbsp;Minalan seeks the knowledge he needs, no matter the price.</p> <p>The Footwizard, Fondaras the Wise, has been to the realm of the jevolar four times in his long life. He knows the way, and he knows the great dangers of the non-magical land. He warns that Anghysbel is filled with forgotten creatures and lost races that have hidden from the world for eons. That doesn’t dissuade the Spellmonger - it’s a challenge. But once he’s there, Minalan’s expedition discovers a unique land filled with forgotten secrets.</p> <p>Dark powers more ancient than the world dwell in exotic Anghysbel, powers that would speed Callidore’s destruction, not work for its salvation. Minalan the Spellmonger has to consider carefully if he’s willing to pay the price to save the world...and the cost of that bargain may well be his life.</p>";
