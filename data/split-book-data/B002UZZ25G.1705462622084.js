window.bookSummaryJSON = "An atmospheric tale of life and love in a Depression-era traveling circus. <p>Nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski reflects back on his wild and wondrous days with a circus. It's the Depression Era and Jacob, finding himself parentless and penniless, joins the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. There he meets the freaks, grifters, and misfits that populate this world. Jacob introduces us to Marlena, beautiful star of the equestrian act; to August, her charismatic but twisted husband (and the circus' animal trainer); and to Rosie, a seemingly untrainable elephant.</p> <p>Beautifully written, with a luminous sense of time and place, <i>Water for Elephants</i> tells of love in a world in which love's a luxury few can afford.</p>";
