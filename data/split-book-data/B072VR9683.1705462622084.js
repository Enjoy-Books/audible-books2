window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Laurie Gelman's clever debut about a year in the life of a kindergarten class mom - a brilliant send-up of the petty and surprisingly cutthroat terrain of parent politics.</b> </p> <p>Jen Dixon is not your typical Kansas City kindergarten class mom - or mom in general. Jen already has two college-age daughters by two different (probably) musicians, and it's her second time around the class mom block with five-year-old Max - this time with a husband and father by her side. Though her best friend and PTA president sees her as the \"wisest\" candidate for the job (or oldest), not all of the other parents agree. </p> <p>From recording parents' response times to her emails about helping in the classroom to requesting contributions of \"special\" brownies for curriculum night, not all of Jen's methods win approval from the other moms. Throw in an old flame from Jen's past, a hypersensitive \"allergy mom\", a surprisingly sexy kindergarten teacher, and an impossible-to-please <i>Real Housewife</i> wannabe causing problems at every turn, and the job really becomes much more than she signed up for. </p> <p>Relatable, irreverent, and hilarious in the spirit of Maria Semple, this is a fresh, welcome voice in fiction - the kind of audiobook that real moms clamor for and a vicarious listen for all mothers, who will be laughing as they are liberated by Gelman's acerbic truths. </p>";
