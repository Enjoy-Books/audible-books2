window.bookSummaryJSON = "From coast to coast and around the world, Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels continue to make best-selling history each summer. In the 13th book in the series, the stakes are raised even higher as Stephanie Plum finds herself in her most dangerous, hilarious, hottest, chase yet. With her lovable, offbeat family along for the ride (as well as a few new faces), there's no doubt that the Stephanie Plum novels put the \"fun\" in dysfunctional. And it's clear to see why they're called \"Hot Stuff\" by the <i>New York Times</i> - and why Evanovich herself is called \"the master\".";
