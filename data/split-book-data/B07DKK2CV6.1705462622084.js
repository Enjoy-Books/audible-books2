window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>A Discovery of Witches</i></b><b> - now a hit TV series on AMC and BBC America and streaming on Sundance Now and Shudder</b> <b>- the fourth novel in the All Souls series. What&nbsp;does it truly take&nbsp;to become a vampire?</b></p> <p>On the battlefields of the American Revolution, Matthew de Clermont meets Marcus MacNeil, a young surgeon from Massachusetts, during a moment of political awakening when it seems that the world is on the brink of a brighter future. When Matthew offers him a chance at immortality and a new life free from the restraints of his puritanical upbringing, Marcus seizes the opportunity to become a vampire. But his transformation is not an easy one, and the ancient traditions and responsibilities of the de Clermont family clash with Marcus's deeply held beliefs in liberty, equality, and brotherhood.</p> <p>Fast-forward to contemporary Paris, where Phoebe Taylor - the young employee at Sotheby's whom Marcus has fallen for - is about to embark on her own journey to immortality. Though the modernized version of the process at first seems uncomplicated, the couple discovers that the challenges facing a human who wishes to be a vampire are no less formidable than they were in the 18th century. The shadows that Marcus believed he'd escaped centuries ago may return to haunt them both - forever.</p> <p>A passionate love story and a fascinating exploration of the power of tradition and the possibilities not just for change but for revolution. <i>Time's Convert,</i> the fourth book in the All Souls series,&nbsp;channels the supernatural world-building and slow-burning romance that made the previous books instant best sellers to illuminate a new and vital moment in history, and a love affair that will bridge centuries.</p>";
