Soon she’s bathing in the master bathtub, drinking their expensive wine, and eyeing the beautifully finished garden apartment in their townhouse. It seems she can never get close enough, until she discovers that photos aren’t all she can manipulate. <br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from Minotaur Books </b></p> <p><b>“The sense of impending disaster is palpable, as the suspense and tension grow, and what happens at the end is unexpected and odd.
