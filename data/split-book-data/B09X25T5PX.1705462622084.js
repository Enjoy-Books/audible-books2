window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jon Hamm leads an all-star cast that includes Kate Mara, Ana de la Reguera, John Slattery, and Bradley Whitford in the riveting true story behind the making of the one American movie the FBI never wanted you to see.</b></p> <p><i>The Big Lie</i> follows FBI special agent Jack Bergin (Jon Hamm), who is sent to investigate three blacklisted filmmakers—Academy Award-winning writer Michael Wilson, Academy Award-nominated producer Paul Jarrico, and director Herbert J. Biberman—who were inspired by a New Mexico labor strike to make a movie that dramatized their pro-labor, pro-feminist beliefs. Convinced the film is a recruitment tool for the Communist Party, Jack will do whatever is necessary to shut the production down.&nbsp;</p> <p>Featuring a star-studded cast that also includes Giancarlo Esposito, David Strathairn, Lisa Edelstein, Raymond Cruz, Troy Evans, Kirk Baltz, John Getz, and Lela Loren, <i>The Big Lie</i> is an explosive story of conspiracy, betrayal, and temptation that resonates with today’s divided America and reminds us all that fear spreads faster than the truth.</p>";
