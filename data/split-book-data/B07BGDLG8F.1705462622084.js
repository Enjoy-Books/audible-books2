window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Elin Hilderbrand, comes a novel about the many ways family can fill our lives with love...if they don't kill us first.</b></p> <p>It's wedding season on Nantucket. The beautiful island is overrun with summer people - an annual source of aggravation for year-round residents. And that's not the only tension brewing offshore. When one lavish wedding ends in disaster before it can even begin - with the bride-to-be discovered dead in Nantucket Harbor just hours before the ceremony - everyone in the wedding party is suddenly a suspect. As Chief of Police Ed Kapenash digs into the best man, the maid of honor, the groom's famous mystery novelist mother, and even a member of his own family, the chief discovers that every wedding is a minefield - and no couple is perfect.</p> <p>Featuring beloved characters from <i>The Castaways </i>and <i>A Summer Affair</i>, <i>The Perfect Couple</i> proves once again that Elin Hilderbrand is the queen of the summer beach book.</p>";
