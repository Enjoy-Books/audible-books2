window.bookSummaryJSON = "Lincoln Rhyme and partner/paramour Amelia Sachs return to face a criminal whose ingenious staging of crimes is enabled by a terrifying access to information.... <p> When Lincoln's estranged cousin Arthur Rhyme is arrested on murder charges, the case is perfect - too perfect. Forensic evidence from Arthur's home is found all over the scene of the crime, and it looks like the fate of Lincoln's relative is sealed.</p> <p> At the behest of Arthur's wife, Judy, Lincoln grudgingly agrees to investigate the case. Soon Lincoln and Amelia uncover a string of similar murders and rapes with perpetrators claiming innocence and ignorance - despite ironclad evidence at the scenes of the crime. Rhyme's team realizes this \"perfect\" evidence may actually be the result of masterful identity theft and manipulation.</p> <p> An information service company - the huge data miner Strategic Systems Datacorp - seems to have all the answers but is reluctant to help the police. Still, Rhyme and Sachs and their assembled team begin uncovering a chilling pattern of vicious crimes and coverups, and their investigation points to one master criminal, whom they dub \"522\".</p> <p> When \"522\" learns the identities of the crime-fighting team, the hunters become the hunted. Full of Deaver's trademark plot twists, <i>The Broken Window</i> will put the partnership of Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs to the ultimate test.</p>";
