window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The thrilling follow-up to the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling novel <i>One Second After</i>. </p> <p>Months before publication, <i>One Second After</i> was cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should have, a book discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at the dangers of EMPs. An EMP is a weapon with the power to destroy the entire United States in a single act of terrorism in a single second; Indeed, it is a weapon that the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> warns could shatter America. <i>One Second After</i> was a dire warning of what might be our future... and our end. </p> <p><i>One Year After</i> returns to the small town of Black Mountain and the man who struggled to rebuild it in the wake of devastation: John Matherson. It is a thrilling follow-up and should delight fans in every way. </p>";
