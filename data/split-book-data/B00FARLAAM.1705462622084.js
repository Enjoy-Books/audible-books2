window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jack Taylor thinks he has a chance at last to rest and heal from the myriad mental and physical traumas that beset him. However, after a skateboarder long suspected of dealing drugs to children is shot dead in mid-air during a public performance, Jack receives a cryptic message with a picture of the skateboarder, a clipping about a rapist gone free through procedural error, and a chilling invitation: \"Your turn.\" The note is signed simply \"C 33.\" </p> <p>From the author considered \"among the most original and innovative noir voices of the last two decades\" (<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>) comes a mystery as labyrinthine as any Jack has yet encountered - and perhaps even more deadly. <i>Purgatory</i> is Ken Bruen at his best: lyrical, brutal, and ceaselessly suspenseful. </p>";
