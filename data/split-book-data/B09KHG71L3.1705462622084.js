When Landon’s brother Trey shows up looking for answers, Abby can’t help but feel the town closing ranks. And she’s still on the outside. When she finds incriminating evidence that may bring them closer to the truth, Abby soon discovers how little she knows about her coworkers, neighbors, and even those closest to her.</p> <p>Megan Miranda brings her best writing to <i>The Last to Vanish</i>, a riveting thriller filled with taut suspense and shocking twists that will keep you guessing until the very end.</p>";
