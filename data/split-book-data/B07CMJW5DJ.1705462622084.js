window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of the best-selling novel <i>The Party - </i>lauded as “tense and riveting” by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Megan Miranda - returns with a chilling new domestic drama about two women whose deep friendship is threatened by dark, long-buried secrets.</p> <p>Frances Metcalfe is struggling to stay afloat.</p> <p>A stay-at-home mom whose troubled son is her full-time job, she thought that the day he got accepted into the elite Forrester Academy would be the day she started living her life. Overweight, insecure, and lonely, she is desperate to fit into Forrester’s world. But after a disturbing incident at the school leads the other children and their families to ostracize the Metcalfes, she feels more alone than ever before.</p> <p>Until she meets Kate Randolph.</p> <p>Kate is everything Frances is not: beautiful, wealthy, powerful, and confident. And for some reason, she’s not interested in being friends with any of the other Forrester moms - only Frances. As the two bond over their disdain of the Forrester snobs and the fierce love they have for their sons, a startling secret threatens to tear them apart...because one of these women is not who she seems. Her real name is Amber Kunik. And she’s a murderer.</p> <p>In her masterful follow-up to <i>The Party</i>, Robyn Harding spins a web of lies, deceit, and betrayal, asking the question: Can people ever change? And even if they can, is it possible to forgive the past?&nbsp;</p>";
