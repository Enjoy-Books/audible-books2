But her well-connected husband, Griffin - who is running for governor - is her prime suspect.</p> <p>Just before the attack, Claire was preparing for an exhibit of her shadow boxes, one of which clearly accuses Griffin of a violent crime committed 25 years ago. If the public were to find out who her husband is, his political career would be over.
