window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BEST SELLER • A hilarious&nbsp;novel of social and political intrigue, set against the glittering backdrop of Florida’s gold coast, from the author of </b><b><i>Skinny Dip</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Razor Girl</i></b></p> <p><b>“If you could use some wild escapism right now, Hiaasen is your guy.” —</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b></p> <p><b>WITH A NEW EPILOGUE</b></p> <p>At the height of Palm Beach’s charity ball season, Kiki Pew Fitzsimmons, a prominent member of geriatric high society, suddenly vanishes during a swank gala. Kiki Pew was a founding member of the Potussies, a group of women dedicated to supporting the President, who spends half the year at the “Winter White House” just down the road. Meanwhile, Angie Armstrong, wildlife wrangler extraordinaire, is called to the island to deal with a monster-sized&nbsp;Burmese python that has taken residency in a tree. But the President is focused on the disappearance of Kiki Pew. Never one to miss an opportunity to play to his base, he immediately declares her a victim of rampaging immigrant hordes. This, it turns out, is far from the truth, which now lies in the middle of the road, where a bizarre discovery brings the First Lady’s motorcade to a grinding halt. Irreverent, ingenious, and uproariously entertaining, <i>Squeeze Me</i> perfectly captures the absurdity of our times.</p>";
