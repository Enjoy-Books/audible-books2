window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Carrie Hope Fletcher and Kwaku Fortune bring genuine emotion to this London rom-com with their impeccable narration about an unlikely friendship.\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile </i></b><b>magazine)</b></p> <p><b>\"Boasting Carrie Hope Fletcher's no-nonsense British accent and Kwaku Fortune's mild Irish brogue...the audio version brings this butterfly-inducing romantic read to life.\" (</b><b><i>Paste</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>This program includes a bonus interview with the author.&nbsp;</p> <p>What if your roommate is your soul mate?&nbsp;</p> <p>A joyful, quirky romantic comedy, Beth O'Leary's <i>The Flatshare</i> is a feel-good audiobook about finding love in the most unexpected of ways.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tiffy and Leon share an apartment. Tiffy and Leon have never met.</p> <p>After a bad breakup, Tiffy Moore needs a place to live. Fast. And cheap. But the apartments in her budget have her wondering if astonishingly colored mold on the walls counts as art.</p> <p>Desperation makes her open minded, so she answers an ad for a flatshare. Leon, a night shift worker, will take the apartment during the day, and Tiffy can have it nights and weekends. He'll only ever be there when she's at the office. In fact, they'll never even have to meet.</p> <p>Tiffy and Leon start writing each other notes - first about what day is garbage day, and politely establishing what leftovers are up for grabs, and the evergreen question of whether the toilet seat should stay up or down. Even though they are opposites, they soon become friends. And then maybe more.</p> <p>But falling in love with your roommate is probably a terrible idea...especially if you've never met.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>The Flatshare</i></b><b>:</b></p> <p><b>\"With likable main characters, spot-on dialogue, a fun premise, and plenty of drama, there's a lot to like in this sweet story. A warm, enchanting love story, perfect for fans of classic rom-coms.\" (</b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"</b><b><i>The Flatshare</i></b><b> is a huge, heartwarming triumph.\" (Josie Silver, number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>One Day in December</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
