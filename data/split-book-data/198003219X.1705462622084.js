Well, almost anything. Emily can't shake her reputation or her memories, and she's planning to drown this whole vacation in a bottle.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lulu's got ex-husbands to spare, and another on the way - as soon as she figures out what the devil the current husband is up to behind her back.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why would they confess to the same murder?
