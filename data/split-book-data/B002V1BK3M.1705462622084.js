window.bookSummaryJSON = "Tennis has been very good to sports agent Myron Bolitar. He represents two of the hottest young stars in the game. But when his female player is murdered in broad daylight at the U.S. Open and his male player becomes the prime suspect, Myron's got a whole new match to win. His investigation leads to an old murder, the mob, a crooked senator, a jealous mother, and someone who's determined to shut down his search for good. <p> In novels that crackle with wit and suspense, Edgar Award-winner Harlan Coben has created one of the most fascinating and complex heroes in suspense fiction, a hot-headed, tender-hearted sports agent who grows more and more engaging and unpredictable with each page-turning appearance.</p>";
