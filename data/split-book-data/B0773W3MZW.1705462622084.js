She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times...and spying on her neighbors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, mother, their teenaged son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn't, her world begins to crumble. And its shocking secrets are laid bare.&nbsp;</p> <p>What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one - and nothing - is what it seems.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Twisty and powerful, ingenious and moving, </b><b><i>The Woman in the Window</i></b><b> is a smart, sophisticated novel of psychological suspense that recalls the best of Hitchcock. </b>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Bonus: </i>Includes an interview with author A.
