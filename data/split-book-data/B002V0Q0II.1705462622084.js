window.bookSummaryJSON = "When reporter Ellen Gleeson gets a \"Have You Seen This Child?\" flyer in the mail, she almost throws it away. But something about it makes her look again, and her heart stops - the child in the photo is identical to her adopted son, Will. Her every instinct tells her to deny the similarity between the boys, because she knows her adoption was lawful. But she's a journalist and won't be able to stop thinking about the photo until she figures out the truth. And she can't shake the question: if Will rightfully belongs to someone else, should she keep him or give him up? <p>She investigates, uncovering clues no one was meant to discover, and when she digs too deep, she risks losing her own life - and that of the son she loves. </p> <p>Lisa Scottoline breaks new ground in <i>Look Again</i>, a thriller that's both heart-stopping and heart-breaking, and sure to have new fans and book clubs buzzing.</p>";
