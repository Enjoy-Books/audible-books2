window.bookSummaryJSON = "It's the last race of the season, the wheels are smoking, and the temperature is rising at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Alexandra Barnaby is NASCAR-driver Sam Hooker's race-day spotter, his eye-in-the-sky, telling him when to pass and when to let off the gas. <p> From her vantage point high above the grandstand, she's also seeing goings-on in the infield that will change her life: events that will lead to a stolen racecar hauler, a kidnapped Saint Bernard, a bizarre murder, some restless nights under the covers with Sam, and a reunion with super cigar roller Rosa Florez and the queen of wholesale fruit, Felicia Ibarra.</p> <p>From Miami, Florida, to Concord, North Carolina, and back to Miami, this is an action-packed, multi-car pileup of shady dealings, stolen technology, drive-thru windows, and destruction of personal property. It offers everything you always wanted to know about righteous indignation, stealing an 18-wheeler, stashing a dead body, and sex in the fast lane.</p>";
