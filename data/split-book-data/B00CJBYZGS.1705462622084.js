window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The highly anticipated, laugh-out-loud third installment in the fan-favorite Junior Bender mysteries</b> </p> <p>There are not many people brave enough to say no to Irwin Dressler, Hollywood’s scariest mob boss turned movie king. Even though Dressler is 93 years old, LA burglar Junior Bender is quaking in his boots when Dressler’s henchmen haul him in for a meeting. Dressler wants Junior to solve a crime he believes was committed more than 70 years ago, when an old friend of his, once-famous starlet Dolores La Marr, had her career destroyed after compromising photos were taken of her at a Las Vegas party. Dressler wants justice for Dolores and the shining career she never had. </p> <p>Junior can’t help but think the whole thing is a little crazy. After all, it’s been 70 years. Even if someone did set Dolores up for a fall from grace, they’re probably long dead now. But he can’t say no to Irwin Dressler - no one can, really - so he starts digging. What he finds is that some vendettas never die; they only get more dangerous.</p>";
