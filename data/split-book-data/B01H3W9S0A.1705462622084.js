window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Chief of Police Kate Burkholder is called upon by the sheriff's department in rural upstate New York to assist in a developing situation that involves a reclusive Amish settlement and the death of a young girl. Unable to penetrate the wall of silence between the Amish and English communities, the sheriff asks Kate to travel to New York, pose as an Amish woman, and infiltrate the community. </p> <p>Kate's longtime love interest, State Agent John Tomasetti, is dead set against her taking on such an unorthodox assignment, knowing she'll have limited communication - and even less in the way of backup. </p> <p>But Kate can't turn her back, especially when the rumor mill boils with disturbing accounts of children in danger. She travels to New York, where she's briefed and assumes her new identity as a lone widow seeking a new life. Kate infiltrates the community and goes deep undercover. </p> <p>In the coming days, she unearths a world built on secrets, a series of shocking crimes, and herself, alone...trapped in a fight for her life. </p>";
